ERROR: Cannot install -r deploy_instructions/requirements.txt (line 1), -r deploy_instructions/requirements.txt (line 2), -r deploy_instructions/requirements.txt (line 6), -r deploy_instructions/requirements.txt (line 7) and numpy==1.24.3 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.24.3
    streamlit 1.30.0 depends on numpy<2 and >=1.19.3
    pandas 2.0.3 depends on numpy>=1.21.0; python_version >= "3.10"
    scikit-learn 1.2.2 depends on numpy>=1.17.3
    tensorflow 2.12.0 depends on numpy<1.24 and >=1.22

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
